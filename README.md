# SideProject

Just a simple Side Project to build a Hybrid Framework from the ground up.
I am adding functions slowly and making simple Test Cases.

I've added Data Driven, Cloud Environments, Headless Driver and also playing
around with BrowserMob Proxy, testing to catch all HTTP Requests during the 
execution of Tests and put the HTTP Requests into a file, in order for me
to convert it into a .JMX file which would be used in JMeter.

However using BrowserMob Proxies are causing massive slowdown during the 
executions, so I am working on a different approach (In Progress).

I will in the future also add some more aspects such as REST API, and
in general make the Framework more dynamic.

The purpose of this project is for learning.
