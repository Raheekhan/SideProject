# SideProject

Just a simple Side Project to build a Hybrid Framework from the ground up.
I am adding functions slowly and making simple Test Cases.

I've added Data Driven, Cloud Environments, Headless Driver and also playing
around with [BrowserMob Proxy](https://bmp.lightbody.net/), testing to catch all HTTP Requests during the
execution of Tests and put the HTTP Requests into a file, in order for me
to convert it into a .JMX file which would be used in JMeter.

However using BrowserMob Proxies are causing massive slowdown during the
executions, so I am working on a different approach (In Progress).

I've added some basic REST API Tests in a separate Module, and will add
more functionalities to it. I am using the 'Fake' [JSON-SERVER](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

The purpose of this project is for learning.
